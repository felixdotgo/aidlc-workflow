# Development guide

This guide is for contributors to `@felixdotgo/aidlc-workflow`. It covers local setup, source ownership, and the rules that keep the package runtime and installed workflow behaviour aligned.

## Requirements and dependencies

- Node.js 20 or newer is required by the package runtime.
- npm installs the repository development dependencies.
- The package currently has no declared runtime npm dependencies; it uses Node.js built-ins at runtime.
- Development uses TypeScript and `@types/node` as declared in `package.json`.

```sh
npm install
```

Codex or Claude Code are optional for manually exercising real evaluator drivers. Ordinary build, lint, and unit-test work does not need external model credentials.

## Repository layout

```text
assets/aidlc/                Source workflow contracts, schemas, and installed scripts
skills/                      Source thin phase adapters
src/                         TypeScript package CLI, installer, lifecycle, profiles, and migrations
dev/evaluator/               Development-only evaluator harness and runners
scripts/build-assets.mjs     Bundles workflow assets for package distribution
test/unit/                   Unit and installed-runtime parity tests
docs/                        User, operator, and contributor documentation
dist/                        Generated TypeScript and bundled assets; do not hand-edit
```

The asset build copies `assets/aidlc/` and `skills/` into `dist/assets/.agents/`. At install time, the package writes the workflow to a consumer project's `.agents/aidlc/` and `.agents/skills/` locations. Always state which of these three layouts—source, bundle, or installed project—you mean in code or documentation.

## Local commands

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run build` | Rebuild bundled workflow assets and compile TypeScript into `dist/`. |
| `npm run lint` | Type-check without emitting files. |
| `npm test` | Build, then run every compiled unit test with Node's test runner. |
| `node --test dist/test/unit/<file>.test.js` | Run a focused compiled test after building. |
| `npm run release:check` | Run the repository release-evidence policy check. |

Run the narrowest relevant test while iterating, then run `npm test` and `npm run lint` before handing off a non-trivial change. See [Testing and release](./testing-and-release.md) for the package smoke test and evaluator.

## Ownership boundaries

The package has three ownership layers:

1. Package-managed kernel assets installed under `.agents/aidlc/`.
2. Project-owned configuration, profiles, rules, and evaluation material under `.agents/project/`.
3. Project-owned task state and derived data under `.agents/data/`.

Do not introduce a second lifecycle board or hand-edit canonical state. The installed lifecycle scripts are dependency-free so consumer projects do not need this package to operate after installation.

## Mirrored runtime behaviour

The TypeScript implementation powers the package CLI. Installed projects use a dependency-free mirror under `assets/aidlc/scripts/`. Changes to shared lifecycle, state, gate, profile, or context behaviour must preserve parity between these paths and add coverage for both package and installed-runtime execution.

Likewise, a public configuration or schema change must update its validator, JSON schema, installed assets, package inventory, documentation, and tests together.

## Safe implementation rules

- Resolve all project-relative paths through the shared path helpers; reject traversal and symlink escape.
- Keep installation, migration, and upgrade plans deterministic and conflict-first.
- Preserve project-owned configuration and state when changing managed assets.
- Do not add remote profile discovery, runtime asset downloads, executable plugin hooks, registry checks, or shell-string command execution.
- Treat human-gated lifecycle transitions as atomic, auditable state operations.

Read [Architecture](./architecture.md) before changing a module boundary, migration, installed script, or bundle layout.

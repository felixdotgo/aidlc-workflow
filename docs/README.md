# Documentation

Use this page to choose the guide that matches your role and next task.

## For package users and operators

1. Start with the repository [README](../README.md) to install the workflow.
2. Read [Operating the workflow](./operating-workflow.md) before asking an agent to change a project.
3. Use [Configuration](./configuration.md) to configure project rules, profiles, and Codex/Claude permissions.
4. Keep [Command reference](./command-reference.md) nearby for safe CLI usage.
5. Read [MCP state service](./mcp-state.md) before enabling remote canonical state.

## For contributors and maintainers

1. Begin with [Development](./development.md) for local setup and implementation boundaries.
2. Use [Testing and release](./testing-and-release.md) for the verification and package-smoke workflow.
3. Read [Architecture](./architecture.md) before changing package, installed-runtime, migration, or asset behaviour.
